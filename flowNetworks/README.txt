Assignment 06 README.txt

COMPILATION:
    Compile source files flow_network_generator.c and max_flow_generator.c using a C compiler. Ensure that the output binaries are named
    flow_network_generator and max_flow_generator.
    Ensure that main.sh has execution permissions.
    Place main.sh and the two C-derived executables in the same working directory.
    Ensure that you possess a copy of the DOT graph rendering utility and that the shell can get to it via the $PATH.

EXECUTION:
    Invocation of main.sh in bash will cause the C executables to be run ten times. The executables will expect directories named input_graphs
    and output_graphs in the working directory.
